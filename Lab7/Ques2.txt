2.  In the code below thereâ€™s a setTimeout call scheduled, then a heavy calculation is run, that takes more than 100ms to finish.

When will the scheduled function run?

After the loop.
Before the loop.
In the beginning of the loop.
What is console.log going to show?

let i = 0;

setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100); // ?

// assume that the time to execute this function is >100ms

for(let j = 0; j < 100000000; j++) {

  i++;

}

==> The scheduled function will run after the loop because the scheduled function is inside the settimeout method (an asynchronous method )  which will stay in the queue
    for the specified time and the other codes below it will run.  After the specified time, the setTimeout function checks if the processor is available. 
    In this case, the processor will not be available and the setTimeout method will wait until the processor is available.
    So, the setTimeout method will run only after the loop.
